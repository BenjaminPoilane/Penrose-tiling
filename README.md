# Penrose tiling

[Penrose tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) are aperiodic tilings of the plane based on the regular pentagon. 
This directory contains files to make Penrose tilings type II and type III tilings which both use two basic tiles. The P2 tiling uses two rhombuses, and the P3 tiling uses a *kite* shaped tile and an *arrow* shaped tile. 

## Files

 - `penrose_P3_tiling.R` generate a penrose P3 tiling (rhombus tiling).
 - `penrose_P2_tiling.R` generate a penrose P2 tiling (kite and darts tiling).
 - the `.jpeg` files are examples of output of these two scripts.
